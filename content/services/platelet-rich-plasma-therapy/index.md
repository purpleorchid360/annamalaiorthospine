**Platelet rich plasma** therapy is commonly referred to as 'PRP'.

Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center offers **PRP Therapy**, an advanced non-operative out-patient procedure that can provide a permanent solution for conditions such as arthritis and ligament/tendon sprains and tears. <!--more--> 30ml of blood is taken from the patient's own body and centrifuged using a special machine to separate the platelets and growth factors from the red and white cells. These platelets have growth factors that can kick start our normal healing process and so they are injected into the damaged ligaments, tendons, and joints to promote tissue repair and accelerate healing. **PRP therapy** produces better tissue healing in tendon injuries and in cartilage defects. On average, an injured individual can get back to a pain-free life in four to six weeks.

**PRP treatment** is a safe option with no risk of allergic reaction because it is your own blood. However, it is not the first line of treatment. We will explore other conservative treatment options and only when they do not produce satisfying results, PRP therapy is suggested. PRP has proven to be effective in treating osteoarthritis by stimulating healing of cartilage and reducing pain. This includes [osteoarthritis](/arthritis-management) of knee, hip, shoulder and ankle
