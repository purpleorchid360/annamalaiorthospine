A fracture refers to a broken bone and this could even be a small crack. The initial management of a fracture involves two important steps: realignment of the broken limb and then immobilizing it with the help of a splint. Splinting provides symptomatic pain relief and prevents further injury to the local soft tissues. <!--more--> Fractures are of 2 types, In the case of a **closed fracture** their skin remains intact and in an **open fracture** the ends of the broken bone tear your skin. When your bone and other internal tissues are exposed, it puts you at higher risk of infection.

At Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center, initial fracture management focuses on controlling hemorrhage, providing pain relief and ensuring the injured part is protected from infection. Then we work towards reducing the fracture and maintaining it that way so that the fractured bone will heal in such a way that it will retain maximum functionality. This means the fracture reduction technique is employed along with immobilization of the fracture limb using a cast or a splint. An undisplaced fracture will heal by casting and immobilization, while a displaced fracture requires surgical treatments, for fracture healing and union. Fixation of fracture with metal screws, pins, rods or plates to hold the bones in place is known as open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Once the fracture has healed, physiotherapy is necessary to restore mobility.
