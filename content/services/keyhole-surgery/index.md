Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center is fully equipped/ trained to perform a **minimally invasive procedure** at the problem area (Spine/ joint). Minimally invasive procedure is commonly called a **Keyhole Surgery** because the incision made is extremely small in comparison to traditional surgery.<!--more--> The cut is small and targeted only at the injured area in order to avoid damaging healthy tissue â€“ this means recovery from the injury and procedure is quicker.

A keyhole surgery is usually performed using an **Arthroscope/ Microscope/ Endoscope** which comes fitted with a state-of-the-art miniature camera, microscope and specialized infrastructure. Today keyhole surgeries of the joints and spine have become routine procedures.
