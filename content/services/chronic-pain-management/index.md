**Chronic pain** lasts for months together and is spread across different parts of the body. **Pain relief** is fleeting. Unlike acute pain that arises suddenly due to a specific cause and goes away with treatment, chronic pain is persistent to such an extent that it interferes with simple daily-tasks/ day to day activities.

What causes chronic pain? In some cases it could be due to another condition such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases doctors find it hard to pin-point the cause. Often chronic pain begins due to a certain injury or disease, and even after recovering from that injury or disease, the pain stays on.

## Treating or managing chronic pain depends on a few key factors:

- Where does the pain develop?
- When did it start?
- How intense is it?
- How often does it occur?
- Any specific triggers that worsen the pain?
- Details regarding past illness or surgeries

**Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj** understands the nature of chronice and that there is no single guaranteed technique to treat chronic pain. **Chronic Pain management** includes a combination of options in the right measure that can provide relief.

## Some Chronic Pain treatment options include:

- Drug therapy/ medication for chronic pain
- Physical therapy by employing stretching strengthening, and pain-relieving techniques
- Exercise- it is easier for certain chronic pain sufferers than others such as swimming, cycling.
- TENS or Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Therapy
- Psychological Treatment
- Surgical procedures such as intrathecal pump and spinal cord stimulator implantation.
