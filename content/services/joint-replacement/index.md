**Joint replacement** surgery at Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center is a routine procedure but it recommended only for people with **chronic joint pain** when other non-surgical treatments have proved unsuccessful. The procedure helps relieve the pain completely and also improves joint mobility. <!--more--> Joint replacement can definitely help to improve overall quality of life by allowing patients to do daily activities free of pain. Depending on the joint that is giving trouble and the extent of damage, your doctor will decide the type of joint replacement surgery required. [**Osteoarthritis**](/arthritis-management) is most often the cause for joint pain that eventually calls for joint replacement surgery. This condition is prevalent with the geriatric population.

Joint replacement surgery involves removal of the worn cartilage with damaged bone and resurfacing it with a metalic artificial joint. The Replacement implant looks and functions much like a normal joint. **Hip Replacement Surgery** and **Knee Replacement Surgery** are the most common types of joint replacement performed. A hip or **knee replacement** is expected to last for 20 or more years making it a lifelong solution or **cure for [arthritis](/arthritis-management)** of the hip or knee.
