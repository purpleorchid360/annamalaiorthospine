**Sciatica** is a collective term for a combination of symptoms such as **leg pain**, tingling or numbness that travels down the low back via the sciatic nerve in the back of the leg. Sciatica can be caused by disc herniation compressing the spine nerve, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondylolisthesis. <!--more--> In order to prevent further damage and to curb the progress of the underlying issue causing sciatica, immediate treatment is essential.

Dr. Vignesh Pusparaj approaches the treatment based on the individual's specific symptoms/ needs. The first line of **sciatica treatment** is most often non-invasive. It typically includes a combination of physical therapy, pain medications, therapeutic injections for pain relief, and alternative therapies. Physical therapy for sciatica aims at strengthening the spine and **lower back muscles**, abdomen, buttocks, and hip and increasing core strength. Stretching tight muscles, such as hamstrings to improves mobility. Light aerobic exercises such as walking, swimming, or pool therapy promotes overall good health and fitness. Too much bed rest can be detrimental to the treatment. Injections are administered in order to reduce inflammation at the nerve root level, this helps reduce **sciatica pain**. The Selective Nerve Root Block injection is administered at the spinal nerve to reduces inflammation and numb the pain signal transmitted by the pinched nerve.

Surgical intervention for Sciatica is prescribed only when the pain does not reduce through these non-invasive methods of treatment and the individual is finding it harder to perform regular everyday activities.
