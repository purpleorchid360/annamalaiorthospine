description: "We at Annamalai Spine and Ortho Center understand how debilitating a spine fracture can be. Unlike a fracture in any other bone, a fracture in the spine can really put you out of action. From experiencing a nagging pain to not being able to stand or walk around t or even be paralyzed, the impact of a spinal injury or fracture can be quite dire."

If you fear that there is some structural problem with your spine, then an appointment with Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj is in order. Kyphosis and Scoliosis affect the structure of the spine. Scoliosis refers to an S-shaped or C-shaped spinal deformity that is noticeable when looking directly at the person. <!--more--> Whereas Kyphosis is an increased forward spinal angulation that is noticeable while looking at someone from the side. In their mild forms, both conditions do not interfere with the normal functioning of the individual. However, if it causes pain and difficulty in walking or standing, then it calls for a visit to the doctor. Scoliosis occurs mostly in children, which worsens with age and maturity. Timely intervention is the key to treating pediatric scoliosis.

The most common cause of Adult scoliosis is degenerative spinal arthritis, which can cause slight instability and eccentric loading of the spine, causing it to curve. The most common cause of adult kyphosis is osteoporosis compression fractures, degenerative spondylosis (arthritis of the spine) or due to post-surgical changes. Pain, difficulty walking, difficulty in standing and a sense of feeling 'off balance' are the most common symptoms of patients with either of these conditions. 

Initial treatment options are conservative modes: Physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and pain relief medication. Epidural steroid injections and/or nerve root blocks are options for those with severe pain or for those who are not seeing results with conservative treatment. When these non-invasive treatment techniques fail, surgical intervention might be necessary. The surgical treatment of adult scoliosis and/or kyphosis is spinal fusion or mending the spine bones together using metal rods and screws.
