description: "The spine is made up of several cylindrical bones called vertebrae and between each vertebra is a disc. These discs are made of a rubbery/jelly material that gives the spine its flexibility. The soft jelly-like centre of the disc, may sometimes leak out due to a weakness in the outer part of the disc. This is what is referred to as a herniated disc or prolapsed disc or protruded disc."

The spine is made up of several cylindrical bones called vertebrae and between each vertebra is a disc. These discs are made of a rubbery/jelly material that gives the spine its flexibility. The soft jelly-like centre of the disc, may sometimes leak out due to a weakness in the outer part of the disc. This is what is referred to as a herniated disc or prolapsed disc or protruded disc.<!--more-->  Though it is commonly called 'slipped disc', the disc does not move but is in fact pressing against a nerve root which can cause lower back pain and leg pain (sciatica). One can have a herniated disc anywhere along our spine, even in our neck, but it’s most likely to occur in the lower back (lumbar vertebrae). If a herniated disc occurs in the neck, there might be pain in the neck, shoulders, and arms. Besides pain, other herniated disc symptoms are numbness, tingling, and weakness. 

A Herniated disc is usually very painful and most people feel much better with nonsurgical treatment in the form of rest, exercise and physiotherapy.Initial line of treatment includes: 
1. Complete Rest
2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication to manage pain and reduce swelling
3. Exercises or physical therapy to improve functionality
4. Selective nerve root block injection to reduce pain signals sent to the brain. 

If these modalities don't help and if the patients have persistent pain that interferes with the quality of life, then Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj suggests surgical intervention. Discectomy is the most common surgery recommended for herniated discs in the lumbar region. The procedure involves removal of the part of the disc that is causing the pressure on the nerve root. Nowadays the surgery involves a smaller incision and special instruments to achieve the same results. This is called Microdiscectomy/ key hole discectomy.
