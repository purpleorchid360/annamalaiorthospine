Inflammation and degeneration in the joints leads to pain and this condition is called **Arthritis**. Pain can be managed to a certain extent with medication and physiotherapy in the initial stages. Arthritis is the kind of condition that gets worse with time.

**Osteoarthritis** and **Rheumatoid Arthritis** are the most common types of this chronic arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a result of the wear and tear of the cartilages in the joints causing **joint pain**. But Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic auto-immune condition that causes pain at various parts of the body especially involving the small joints. Joint replacement surgery is not the first course of action, but the final one. At the outset, Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj suggests other non-surgical methods to control arthritis pain – such as:

- Using hot and cold packs for pain relief
- Taking a course of pain medication
- Therapist assisted physiotherapy
- Steroid and oil injections in the joints to reduce swelling, pain and to increase the joint lubrication.
- Stem cell therapy/ PRP therapy (platelet-rich plasma) to slow down the disease's progress and to have some regeneration.
- Weight management
