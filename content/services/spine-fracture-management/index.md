We at Annamalai Spine and Ortho Center understand how debilitating a spine fracture can be. Unlike a fracture in any other bone, a fracture in the spine can really put you out of action. From experiencing a nagging pain to not being able to stand or walk around t or even be paralyzed, the impact of a spinal injury or fracture can be quite dire.<!--more--> A spine fracture and dislocation can pinch, compress and even tear the spinal cord, causing terrible pain and paralysis of the parts below the level of injury. Treatment of spinal fractures depends on the type of fracture and the extent of the injury.

## Spine Fracture Types:

- The most common type is spine compression fracture where excessive downward force shatters and collapses the body of the vertebrae.
- When the discs connecting two vertebrae together get overly stretched or are torn, the bones may come out of alignment leading to a vertebral dislocation that can cause spinal instability.
- Fracture-dislocations happen when the bone is broken and the ligaments/discs are torn.

**Treatment of spine injury and spine fracture is a medical/ surgical emergency. Spine fractures with paralysis need treatment within the first 24 hours of injury. Thus we can try and restore the normal function back.**

## Spine Fracture Treatment options:

Treatment depends on the type of fracture, degree of spinal instability and its associated spinal cord injury.

1. Surgery to stabilize the spine and to relieve the spinal cord/nerves from compression.
2. Minimally invasive spine fracture stabilisation
3. Fracture stabilisation with anterior bone reconstruction.
