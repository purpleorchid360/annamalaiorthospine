Physiotherapy treatment finds use in both prevention and rehabilitation. It can also be part of the treatment for problems caused by injury, disease or disability. Physiotherapy has proven beneficial in the following cases:

- Neck pain and back pain
- Arthritis related problems in the bones, joints, muscles and ligaments
- After-effects of amputation
- Asthma
- Stroke
- Loss of mobility because of trauma to the brain or spine
- Fatigue, pain, swelling, stiffness and loss of muscle strength as side effects from treatments for diseases such as cancer

An X-ray is an imaging technique used to get a closer look at problems causing bones and joints. Bone related problems that may be detected during an X-ray include:

- bone fractures and breaks
- Joint orthritis
- scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine)
- Abnormal bony growth (Cancer/ Carcinoma)
